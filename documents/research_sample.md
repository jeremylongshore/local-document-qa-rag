# Artificial Intelligence in Document Processing

## Abstract
This paper explores the use of AI for document analysis and question-answering systems.

## Introduction
The field of natural language processing has advanced significantly with the introduction of large language models.

## Methodology
We implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using:
- Vector embeddings for document retrieval
- Local language models for response generation
- Streamlit for user interface

## Results
Our system achieved 95% accuracy on document-based questions while maintaining complete privacy through local processing.

## Conclusion
Local RAG systems provide an effective solution for private document analysis.
