# Artificial Intelligence in Document Processing

## Abstract
This paper explores the use of AI for document analysis and question-answering systems.

## Introduction
The field of natural language processing has advanced significantly with the introduction of large language models.

## Methodology
We implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using:
- Vector embeddings for document retrieval
- Local language models for response generation
- Streamlit for user interface

## Results
Our system achieved 95% accuracy on document-based questions while maintaining complete privacy through local processing.

## Conclusion
Local RAG systems provide an effective solution for private document analysis.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How does the system work?
A: The system processes your documents, creates embeddings, and uses a local AI model to answer questions based on document content.

Q: Is my data secure?
A: Yes, all processing happens locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers.

Q: What file formats are supported?
A: Currently supported formats include PDF, TXT, and MD files.

Q: How accurate are the answers?
A: Accuracy depends on document quality and question complexity, typically achieving 90%+ relevance.

Q: Can I use different AI models?
A: Yes, you can switch between different Ollama models like Llama 3, Mistral, or others.

## üìÅ Document Types to Test

### **Business Documents**
- Company policies and procedures
- Employee handbooks  
- Training materials
- Meeting minutes
- Project documentation

### **Academic Papers**
- Research publications
- Thesis documents
- Literature reviews
- Technical reports
- Course materials

### **Technical Documentation**
- API documentation
- User manuals
- Installation guides
- Troubleshooting guides
- Code documentation

### **Legal Documents**

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### **Basic Questions**
- "What is this document about?"
- "Summarize the main points"
- "What are the key requirements?"

### **Specific Queries**
- "How do I install the software?"
- "What are the system requirements?"
- "Who is the author of this document?"

### **Complex Questions**
- "Compare the features mentioned in different documents"
- "What are the pros and cons of the approach described?"
- "How does this relate to the other documents?"

### **Edge Cases**
- Questions about content not in documents
- Very specific technical details
- Questions requiring external knowledge

## üìä Quality Assessment

### **Good Responses Should**
- ‚úÖ Be based on document content
- ‚úÖ Cite relevant information
- ‚úÖ Stay within scope of documents
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge limitations

### **Watch Out For**
- ‚ùå Hallucinated information
- ‚ùå Responses without document basis
- ‚ùå Overly confident wrong answers
- ‚ùå Failure to find relevant content

## üîÑ Testing Workflow

1. **Add documents** to the `documents/` folder
2. **Start the application** with `streamlit run app.py`
3. **Wait for processing** (first run takes longer)
4. **Ask test questions** to validate functionality
5. **Evaluate responses** for accuracy and relevance
6. **Iterate and improve** based on results
