## 🧩 Issues Found

1. **Local pytest unavailable** - Tests run in CI but not locally without venv
2. **Demo screenshots missing** - Placeholder images in README need actual screenshots
3. **Heavy dependencies** - App requires Ollama + models for full functionality
4. **Integration tests non-blocking** - Currently set to `continue-on-error: true`

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Tomorrow)

1. **Add demo content**
   - Create actual screenshots/GIF of NEXUS in action
   - Add to `docs/demo-screenshot.png` and `docs/nexus-demo.gif`

2. **Improve test coverage**
   - Add real unit tests for document processing
   - Test the RAG pipeline components individually
   - Consider mocking Ollama for tests

3. **Documentation enhancement**
   - Add API documentation if exposing endpoints
   - Create troubleshooting guide
   - Add performance benchmarks with real data

4. **Feature additions**
   - Implement health check endpoint
   - Add metrics dashboard in Streamlit
   - Create Docker image for easier deployment

5. **Community engagement**
   - Share on relevant subreddits/forums
   - Create demo video for social media
   - Consider writing blog post about local RAG

## 💡 Notes
The NEXUS project has been successfully transformed from a basic local document Q&A system into a professional, portfolio-ready autonomous AI agent. The repository now presents as an enterprise-grade solution with proper CI/CD, documentation, and release management. The "tech bro" aesthetic has been achieved with modern badges, comparison tables, and emphasis on being an "AI agent" rather than just a RAG implementation.
