# Project Status: Local Document Q&A RAG

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-19

We are in the process of setting up the `Local-Document-QA-RAG` project.

## Where We Left Off:
1.  Reviewed `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
2.  Confirmed Python 3.13.5 is available at `c:/Users/jeremy/Python313/python.exe`.
3.  Attempted to check for Ollama, but the `ollama` command was not found.

## ðŸ”´ Next Action Required:
**You need to install Ollama.**
1.  Download and install it from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).
2.  After installation, you may need to restart your terminal.
3.  Verify the installation by opening a new terminal and running `ollama list`.
4.  Pull a model by running `ollama run llama3` or `ollama run gemma2`.

Once Ollama is installed and a model is downloaded, we can continue with the setup.
